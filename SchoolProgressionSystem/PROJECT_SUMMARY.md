## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Backend Technologies
- **Flask 2.3.3**: Web framework
- **Pandas 2.0.3**: Data processing
- **NumPy 1.24.3**: Numerical computations
- **Folium 0.14.0**: Interactive maps
- **Scikit-learn 1.3.0**: Distance calculations
- **Openpyxl 3.1.2**: Excel file support

### Frontend Technologies
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0**: Responsive framework
- **Font Awesome 6.4.0**: Icons
- **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**: Animations
- **Custom CSS**: Government-style theming

### Data Processing

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Installation
```bash
./setup.sh    # Run setup script
./run.sh      # Start the application
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py
```

### Access
- Application URL: http://localhost:5013
- Sample data included for testing

## 📊 Data Format Requirements

### School Database CSV Columns
- **School_Name/SchoolName**: School identifier
- **Latitude/Lat/_yCord**: Geographic latitude
- **Longitude/Lon/_xCord**: Geographic longitude
- **District**: Administrative district
- **Level/SchoolLevel**: Educational level (Primary/Middle/High/Higher Secondary)
- **Type** (optional): Government/Private classification

### Analysis Logic
- **Primary** → finds nearest **Middle** schools
- **Middle** → finds nearest **High** schools  
- **High** → finds nearest **Higher Secondary** schools
- **Higher Secondary** → no progression (terminal level)

## 🎯 User Workflow

1. **Upload Complete School Database**: CSV/Excel file with all available schools
2. **Upload Target Schools**: CSV/Excel file with schools needing progression options
3. **Configure Analysis**: Select district, set distance parameters, choose filters
4. **View Results**: Interactive map, detailed table, statistical summary
5. **Download Reports**: CSV file with complete analysis results
