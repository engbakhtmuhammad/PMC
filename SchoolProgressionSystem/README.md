# School Progression Analysis System

A comprehensive web application for analyzing school progression paths in Balochistan, Pakistan. This system helps educational planners identify the nearest progression schools for students transitioning between educational levels (Primary â†’ Middle â†’ High â†’ Higher Secondary).

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Functionality
- **Two-Phase Upload System**: Upload complete school database first, then target schools for analysis
- **Intelligent Progression Mapping**: Automatically finds nearest progression schools based on educational levels
- **Distance-Based Analysis**: Configurable maximum distance parameters for realistic recommendations
- **District Filtering**: Focus analysis on specific districts or analyze all districts

### ðŸ“Š Advanced Analytics
- **Interactive Map Visualization**: Folium-powered maps with connecting lines between target and progression schools
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed CSV reports with distance calculations and school information
- **Statistical Summary**: Analysis overview with success rates and average distances
- **Flexible School Type Filtering**: Include/exclude government or private schools

### ðŸŽ¨ Modern UI/UX
- **Government-Grade Design**: Professional, accessible interface following government design standards
- **Responsive Layout**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Elegant Animations**: Smooth transitions and loading states for better user experience
- **Drag & Drop Upload**: Intuitive file upload with progress indicators

## School Level Progression Logic

The system follows the standard Pakistani education system progression:
- **Primary** â†’ **Middle School**
- **Middle** â†’ **High School** 
- **High** â†’ **Higher Secondary**
- **Higher Secondary** â†’ (No progression within basic education)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/SchoolProgressionSystem
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   Open your web browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:5013`

## Data Format Requirements

### School Database CSV Format
Your complete school database should include these columns (exact names not required - the system will map them):
- **School Name**: Name of the school
- **Latitude**: Geographic latitude coordinate
- **Longitude**: Geographic longitude coordinate  
- **District**: District name
- **Level**: School level (Primary, Middle, High, Higher Secondary)
- **Type** (optional): Government/Private classification

### Target Schools CSV Format
The target schools file should follow the same format as the complete database. These are the schools for which you want to find progression options.

### Sample Data
The system includes sample data for testing. Click "Try with Sample Data" on the main page to explore the functionality.

## Usage Guide

### Step 1: Upload Complete School Database
1. Navigate to the main page
2. Upload your complete school database CSV/Excel file in the first upload area
3. Click "Upload School Database" to process the file

### Step 2: Upload Target Schools
1. Upload the target schools file in the second upload area
2. Click "Upload Target Schools" to process the file

### Step 3: Configure Analysis
1. After both uploads, you'll be redirected to the configuration page
2. Select the target district or choose "All Districts"
3. Set the maximum search distance (1-100 km)
4. Choose additional filters (school type, sorting preferences)
5. Click "Start Analysis"

### Step 4: Review Results
1. View the interactive map showing progression connections
2. Review the detailed results table with distance calculations
3. Download CSV reports and interactive maps
4. Use search functionality to find specific schools
