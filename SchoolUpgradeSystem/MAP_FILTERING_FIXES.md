# Map Filtering and Full Map View Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Map Showing All Data Instead of Filtered Results
**Problem**: After applying filters, the map was still displaying all schools in the database instead of only the filtered schools that were relevant to the analysis.

**Solution**: Modified the backend data preparation to filter schools based on the districts where upgrade candidates are found.

**Changes Made**:
```python
# Get schools that are in the same districts as upgrade candidates
upgrade_districts = set(upgrade_candidates['District'].unique()) if not upgrade_candidates.empty else set()

# Filter schools to only those in districts with upgrade candidates
if upgrade_districts:
    filtered_schools = analyzer.schools_df[analyzer.schools_df['District'].isin(upgrade_districts)].copy()
else:
    filtered_schools = pd.DataFrame()  # Empty if no upgrades
```

**Result**: Map now only shows schools from districts that have upgrade recommendations, dramatically reducing visual clutter and improving focus on relevant areas.

### 2. Full Map View Button Not Working
**Problem**: The "Full Map View" button was getting stuck and not properly entering/exiting fullscreen mode.

**Root Cause**: JavaScript function was trying to access `event.target` without the event being properly passed.

**Solution**: 
1. Modified function to accept button reference as parameter
2. Updated HTML onclick to pass `this` reference
3. Added `return false;` to prevent default link behavior

**Changes Made**:
```javascript
// Fixed function signature
function toggleFullMapView(button) {
    // ... implementation uses passed button parameter
}

// Fixed HTML
<a href="#" onclick="toggleFullMapView(this); return false;" class="btn btn-info-elegant btn-elegant">
```

**Result**: Full map view now properly toggles between normal and fullscreen modes.

### 3. Enhanced Upgrade Candidate Icons
**Problem**: Upgrade candidate icons needed to match the green arrow design shown in the screenshot.

**Solution**: Updated JavaScript icon creation to use green background with white arrow, matching the visual design.

**Changes Made**:
```javascript
const upgradeIcon = L.divIcon({
    html: `<div style="background: #059669; border-radius: 50%; width: 24px; height: 24px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid white; box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);">
            <i class="fas fa-arrow-up" style="color: white; font-size: 12px;"></i>
           </div>`,
    iconSize: [24, 24],
    iconAnchor: [12, 12],
    popupAnchor: [0, -12],
    className: 'custom-upgrade-icon'
});
```

**Result**: Upgrade candidates now display with distinctive green circular icons with white arrow-up symbols, exactly matching the screenshot design.

### 4. Added Professional Map Legend
**Problem**: Map needed a clear legend to explain icon meanings.

**Solution**: Added a dynamic legend control positioned at bottom-left of map.

**Features**:
- Shows all school level colors
- Displays upgrade recommendation icon
- Professional styling with shadows and clean typography
- Responsive design

**Result**: Users can now easily understand what each icon and color represents on the map.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes (`app.py`)
- **Line ~627**: Added district-based school filtering logic
- **Line ~842**: Changed port from 5007 to 5009 to avoid conflicts

### Frontend Changes (`results_elegant.html`)
- **Lines ~1000-1020**: Enhanced upgrade icon design
- **Lines ~1070-1085**: Added comprehensive map legend
- **Lines ~1120-1140**: Fixed full map view toggle function
- **Line ~882**: Updated button onclick handler

### Visual Improvements
1. **Cleaner Map Display**: Only relevant schools shown
2. **Distinctive Icons**: Green arrows for upgrades, colored circles for school levels
3. **Professional Legend**: Clear explanation of all map elements
4. **Working Controls**: Full map view properly toggles
5. **Better Performance**: Fewer markers = faster rendering

## Testing Verified
- ✅ Map only shows filtered schools in relevant districts
- ✅ Upgrade candidates display with green arrow icons
- ✅ Full map view button properly enters/exits fullscreen
- ✅ Legend appears and explains all map elements
- ✅ Icons match the provided screenshot design
- ✅ Responsive behavior maintained across devices
