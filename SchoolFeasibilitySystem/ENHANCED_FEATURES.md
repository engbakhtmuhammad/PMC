4. Analyze feasibility with 2km minimum distance
5. View detailed map with nearest schools highlighted
```

### Scenario 2: Multi-District Comprehensive Analysis
```
1. Select "Quetta", "Ziarat", and "Killa Saifullah" districts
2. Choose all school levels
3. Add 10 proposed locations across districts
4. Analyze with different minimum distances per level
5. Download comprehensive report with statistics
```

### Scenario 3: High-Density Area Analysis
```
1. Select urban districts
2. Focus on "High" and "Higher Secondary" levels
3. Use larger minimum distances (10-15km)
4. Analyze population density impacts
5. Review conflict visualization and recommendations
```
