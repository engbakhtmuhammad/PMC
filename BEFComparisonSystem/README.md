source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create directories
mkdir -p uploads downloads static/css templates

# Start the application
python app.py
```

## Usage Guide

### 1. Data Upload
- **Government Schools**: Upload CSV/Excel file containing government school data
- **BEF Schools**: Upload CSV/Excel file containing BEF school data
- **Required Columns**: Ensure your data includes latitude, longitude, and district information

### 2. Configure Analysis
- **Select Districts**: Choose which districts to include in the analysis
- **Set Distance Threshold**: Define maximum distance for proximity calculations
- **Choose Analysis Type**: Select from proximity, distribution, or comprehensive analysis
- **Output Options**: Configure what to include in results (map, statistics, CSV export)

### 3. View Results
- **Interactive Map**: Explore school locations with click-for-details functionality
- **Statistical Dashboard**: View key metrics and insights
- **District Analysis**: Detailed breakdown for each selected district
- **Download Results**: Export comprehensive data for further analysis

## Data Format Requirements

### Expected Columns
Your CSV/Excel files should include:
- **Latitude**: Decimal degrees (e.g., 30.3753)
- **Longitude**: Decimal degrees (e.g., 69.3451)
- **District**: Administrative district name
- **School Name**: Name of the educational institution
- **Additional Info**: Any other relevant school details

### Sample Data Structure
```csv
School Name,District,Latitude,Longitude,Level,Type

## Configuration Options

### Distance Analysis
- **Range**: 0.5 km to 50 km
- **Default**: 10 km proximity threshold
- **Use Case**: Adjust based on your analysis requirements

### District Selection
- **Multi-select**: Choose specific districts or all districts
- **Search Function**: Quick filtering of district list
- **Real-time Counts**: See school counts per district

### Output Customization
- **Interactive Map**: Toggle map generation
- **Statistical Summary**: Include/exclude detailed statistics
- **CSV Export**: Enable downloadable results

## Performance Considerations

### Optimal Data Sizes
- **Recommended**: Up to 10,000 schools per dataset
- **Maximum File Size**: 50MB per upload
- **Processing Time**: Varies with dataset size and analysis complexity

### Memory Usage
- Large datasets may require more system memory
- Map generation is memory-intensive for 1000+ schools
- Consider district-based analysis for very large datasets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Upload Failures**
- Verify CSV/Excel format is correct
- Check for required columns (latitude, longitude, district)
- Ensure file size is under 50MB limit

**Map Not Loading**
- Refresh the page after analysis completion
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify coordinate data is valid (decimal degrees)

**Analysis Errors**
- Ensure at least one district is selected
- Verify both datasets are uploaded successfully
- Check for missing or invalid coordinate data

### Error Messages
- **"No valid coordinates found"**: Check latitude/longitude columns
- **"District not found"**: Verify district name consistency
- **"Upload failed"**: Check file format and size
